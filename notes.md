## Basics

1 Match
1+ Game(s) in a Match
Team: 1 or 2 Players
Team Score for the whole Match
2-4 Players
2v2, 1v1 or 1v1v1
2 packs of standard Cards (2 x 52 cards + 4 Jokers)
Card Ranks: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A + Joker
Card Suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades
Card Melds: Runs and Groups

Aces come both before deuces and after Kings, so ordering is undefined

## Match Setup

Team members sit opposite each other
Random selection determines which Player is the Dealer for the first Game
The Player to the right of the Dealer is the Pot Hands Dealer
Player order is clockwise, starting with the Player to the left of the Dealer
Dealer responsibility also rotates clockwise, every Game

## Game Setup

Shuffle: The Dealer shuffles the Deck
Cut: The Pot Hands Dealer cuts the deck
Deal Pot Hands: The Pot Hands Dealer deals 2 11 Card Pot Hands, cross-stacked to the side
Deal Player Hands: The Dealer deals 11 Cards to each Player, in a round-robin, clockwise manner
The Stock: The combined, remaining Cards forms the Stock
The Discard Pile: Turn over the top Card of the Stock to start the Game

## Wildcards

The 4 Jokers are always Wildcards
The 8 Deuces are Wildcards if they are subsituting a Card in a Run
A Meld may have at most 1 Wildcard

A Run may have 2 deuces only
Being a Wildcard is a dynamic property, dependant on the Meld

## Melds

Melds are shared by both Players in the Team, building on each other's in turn

2 types of Melds:
 *   Run: 3+ Cards of the same suit, in sequential increasing or decreasing order
 * Group: 3+ Cards of the same rank

Melds of 7+ Cards earn extra points for the team, 1 of 2 ways:
* Clean Meld: 7+ Cards without a Wildcard
   shown by the last 2 Cards placed face up across the others in a horizontal position
* Dirty Meld: 7+ Cards with a Wildcard
   shown by the last Card placed face up across the others in a horizontal position
   every Group with a Wildcard with always be Dirty

## Various rules

Book-end Wildcards are placed at the bottom of a Meld
No Wildcard Groups
Up to 1 Wildcard per Meld
No discarding the single Card drawn from the Discard Pile
No discarding a Wildcard when ending the Game

Corner case:
  Given:
    * with a 3 of Clubs in Hand
    * the Discard Pile containing only the other 3 of Clubs is drawn
    * then the 3 of Clubs is discarded

## Turn Gameplay

Examine: Before drawing, Players may examine and re-arrange the Discard Pile in any manner
 A Player may not advise, verbally or otherwise,
  their teammate on whether they prefer a draw from the Stock or the Discard Pile

Draw, either by:
 * taking the top Card of the Stock
 * pick-up all of the Cards in the Discard Pile.

Meld:
 New Melds or add Cards to their own team's existing Melds
 Wildcards may be moved within a Meld
 Aces may rank high or low and more than 1 Ace may be played in a Meld

Discard 1 Card or pick up the Pot Hand if "In-Flight"

If a Player plays all the Cards in their hand and their team has not yet taken a Hand from the Pot
 then the Player picks-up the next Hand from the Pot

The Player who has melded all their Cards takes a Hand from the Pot and if the Player:
 * has not discarded, continues to play ("In-Flight") from the new Hand
 * has discarded, play frm the new Hand commences at that Player's next turn.
   This new Hand may only be played at the Player's next turn
   and must not even be looked at until the Player's partner has taken their turn

If a team has picked up a Hand from the Pot and they do not have a Clean Meld
 then that team may not play all the Cards in either of their Hands

If:
 * a Player plays all the Cards in their Hand
 * the team has taken a hand from the Pot
 * the team has at least 1 Clean Meld
 then the Game ends

If the Stock is empty and there are Cards in the Pot
 then the next Hand from the Pot will be moved into the Stock
 In this case, it is certain at least 1 team will need to subtract points
  from their total amount earned for the Match

If the Stock is empty and there are not any Cards in the Pot
 then the Game is over without either team earning additional points for ending that Game

If the Game isn't over, then the Turn passes, clockwise

## Scoring

505+, 1005+ or 2005+ points wins the Match
Ending the Game is +100 points
Clean Melds are worth +200 points
Dirty Melds are worth +100 points
Each Card played in a Meld earns a point value for the team that played the Card:
 30 points: Joker
 20 points: 2
 15 points: A
 10 points: K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8
  5 points: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3
Not taking a Hand from the Pot is -100 points
Cards in Hands count negatively against the team score
A newly picked-up Pot Hand counts as either -100 points or minus the combined point value of all the Cards

## Variations

 * In 1v1v1 the Pot Hands contain 11 and 11 Cards each, with the 18 Card Hand picked first
 * Semi Clean Meld: 8 Cards, including a Wildcard, but 7 sequential Cards make no use of a Wildcard; worth 150 pts

## Differences in Buraco

Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buraco

No Jokers
2v2 only
Cut Deck to establish who deals first
 The Player from the team who has the lowest Card is the Dealer
 and must deal to the Player of the other team who has cut the highest Card
 In case of 2 identical Cards being chosen, 2 new Cards must be cut
3000+ points to win the Match
Can play 2v2v2 or 3v3 with an extra Deck and an extra Pot Hand
First Draw Rule:
  The first play is made by the Player to the left of the Dealer.
  The top Card is drawn from the Stock.
  If the Player likes that Card, it is placed into the 1st Player's Hand.
  If the 1st Player does not want the 1st Card of the Game
   then that Card is immediately turned face-up to the side of the Stock to begin the Discard Pile
   and the 1st Player draws another Card from the Stock
  If the 1st Player accepts the first Card of the Game
   then another Card may not be drawn by that Player on that turn
  As soon as the first Card drawn is placed in the Hand of the 1st Player
   then that Player has accepted that Card - if the Player discards this same Card after it is placed in the Hand
   then the Player has exhausted their turn and play proceeds to the next Player
Initial Melding Rule:
  A team may only being to place Melds onto the table if they meld a minimum number of initial points
  This minimum initial Meld amount varies based upon Team score:
   minimum 50 points: for teams with <  1500 points
   minimum 75 points: for teams with >= 1500 points
  If a team fails to meld the minimum initial amount of points
   then all the Melds are placed back into the Hand of the Player
   and 15 more points are added to the initial amount to meld for that team during that Game

Scoring variants:
 20 points: Joker
 10 points: 2, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8
  5 points: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3

More variants:

 * Add the Jokers as Wildcards with a value of 30 points each
 * Add 1 more deck of Cards so there can be 3 teams of 2 Players each, or 2 teams of 3 Players each
   The Pot will consist of 3 Hands and the person making the Pot will cut for 33 Cards
 * Aces are high only or Aces are low only
 * The Game ends on either a Clean Meld or Dirty Meld
 * Play for a predefined duration rather than a point total. The team with the most points wins.
 * 2 or 3 single Players
 * If exactly 22 Cards are cut off the top, that team immediately gains 100 extra points
 * A Meld with 7 clean Cards plus a deuce is worth 150 points, but only in 1 of 8 Italian "Burraco Federations"
